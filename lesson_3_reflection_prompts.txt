When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

if am working with others we have to share the repository using github


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

because i don't want all my branches to be shared public if i'm still testing for example
also changes to remote repository may come from another computer than mine so i have to pull to get changes

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

forks: clone repository from github to my account
branch: create branch locally to commit 
clone: from github to local repository


When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
seperate branch to test new theories and to make pull requests 
directly in master if am working alone or making some thing small or important like fixing bugs 
doesn't have to wait for opinions
